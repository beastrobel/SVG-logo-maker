## Description

The challenge was to develop a SVG logo generator in Node.js. The application uses inquirer npm to prompt the user in the terminal (index.js) for logo text, shape and color. Once the selections are made, the application imports classes from a separate module (shapes.js), which has presets for the Circle, Triangle, and Square shapes. The application passes the user data through the appropriate class, based on the selected shape, and renders a string containing the SVG file contents. Finally, the application writes a new SVG file (logo.svg), which is ready for use. SVG Logo Maker also includes a testing suite (shapes.test.js), with six different tests. It runs on jest npm, as well as validate-color npm, and it checks for text length, valid color input, and whether each shape is  rendered correctly. 

## Installation

To utilize the SVG Logo Maker, please install Node.js and the following npms: inquirer, jest, and validate-color.

## Usage

The video below demonstrates the SVG Logo Maker's functionality, and the screenshot below shows an example of an SVG file generated by the app.
